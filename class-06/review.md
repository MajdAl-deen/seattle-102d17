# Review of CSS

- Harder to work with than expected
- Syntax things, understanding. Google-fu was strong
- Super powerful.  Big fan so far.

- Did some you-tube to get some info.
- Started to makes sense

- Dont get caught in the pit of confusion. <----  This right here!!!
- CSS can be a rabbit hole that you never get out of.
- SO much info.

- Understand the use of the syntax.  CSS is a language.  Got use out of class and ID's.  

General THoughts?
