# JavaScript Functions

- Not as bad bad as I amde it seem.
- Made sense
- Easy to refer back to 
- Not completely overwealmed
- Get the initial understanding down
- Had minor issues at first but able to overcome
- Simple format.  Had punctuation issues.
- Once it clicked was able to put all JS into a single file.

- What happen in the function, stays in the function.

function askName(){
    // does a thing
    return name;
}

function aksAge(){
    // does a thing
    return age;
}

function message(name, age){
    message = "The user name is " + name + " " + " and they are " + age + " years old"
    return message
}
        'Roger'     45
message(askName(), askAge())

message('Roger', 45)
